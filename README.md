# Corona-Chatbot
Chatbot developed by Tensorflow, Flask, created to answer Frequently asked questions about COVID-19 (Corona virus)
The answers were imported from WHO's FAQs.

Timeline:

  created a neural network    --Bahaa

  added the FAQs from the WHO in a json file "intents.json"   --Raafat

  trained the bot on both the arabic and english messages sent    --Ragy

  removed any duplicate words and cleaned the messages sent (removed capitals, symbols...etc)   --Raafat

  saved the words form the FAQ in a pickle file "data.pickle"   --Zeyad

  saved model in "model.tflearn"     --Bahaa

  added an arabic version for the FAQs in "intents-arabic.json"   --Zeyad

  added "data-arabic.pickle"    --Ragy

  saved arabic mode model in "model-arabic.tflearn"   --Bahaa




Problems:
How to receive an answer and save it to a variable (arabic_mode)? the file keeps reloading so the variable is set back to default
